summarize this :

On Thursday, July 13th 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) released their "Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services." In it, the Chinese government lays out its rules to regulate those who provide generative AI capabilities to the public in China. While many provisions of the law focus on traditional AI safety measures such as IP protections, transparency, and discrimination, other sections are quite unique to China, such as adherence to the values of socialism and the prohibition of generating incitement against the State.

Unsurprisingly, AI stands apart from other technologies in how it has spurred major countries to closely examine their national and geopolitical standings regarding the development of this technology.

Given these recent developments in China, let’s explore how these regulatory approaches differ from those in the United States and the European Union.

China
Key Theme: state control; economic dynamism

The Great (AI) Firewall
The Chinese government sees AI as a strategic technology that can help it achieve its economic and geopolitical goals, and as such has been actively promoting the development and adoption of AI. However, China’s approach to AI also raises concerns about privacy and civil liberties, as the government has been known to use AI for surveillance, censorship, and social control purposes. Generative AI presents a risk for state control beyond those risks presented with the internet.

Under these new regulations, firms must require a license to provide generative AI services to the public and submit a security assessment if public opinion attributes or social mobilization capabilities are used in the model. In China, generative AI providers must uphold the integrity of state power, refrain from inciting secession, safeguard national unity, preserve economic and social order, and ensure the development of products aligning with the country's socialist values.

China has also been building its bureaucratic toolkits to quickly and iteratively propose new AI governance laws – allowing it to quickly adjust regulatory guidance as new use cases of the technology get adopted.

AI as an Economic Tool
Despite the Chinese government’s concerns about Generative AI applications, the country is deeply committed to investing in AI across sectors. China accounted for nearly one-fifth of global private investment funding in 2021, attracting $17 billion for AI start-ups. In research, China produced about one-third of both AI journal papers and AI citations worldwide in 2021. Researchers estimate that AI can create upwards of $600 billion in economic value annually for the country. Expect China to continue investing in AI to support its transportation, manufacturing, and defense sectors. Lastly, the manufacturing and distribution of semiconductors will also play a critical role in AI development.

China will ensure information generated by AI aligns with the interests of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). However, recognizing AI's economic potential, China will strategically utilize it to enhance global commercial and technological goals.

United States
Key Theme: self regulation, pro-innovation

Federal Approach is TBD
The United States Congress has taken a relatively hands-off approach to regulating AI thus far, though the Democratic Party’s leadership has expressed its intent to introduce a federal law regulating AI. Republicans will likely present their version as well. We expect the likelihood of such a law to pass through Congress as low. The country's regulatory framework is largely based on voluntary guidelines like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and self-regulation by the industry.

However, US Federal Agencies are likely to step in to regulate within their jurisdictional authority. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been active in policing deceptive and unfair practices related to AI, particularly enforcing statutes such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and FTC Act. They have released publications outlining rules for AI development and use. These rules include training AI with representative data sets, testing AI before and after deployment to avoid bias, ensuring explainable AI outcomes, and establishing accountability and governance mechanisms for fair and responsible AI use. In addition, certain sectors such as healthcare and financial services are subject to specific regulations related to AI.

While the US generally favors a "light touch" approach to regulation in order to foster innovation and growth in the AI industry, the country is starting to align with the EU on international cooperation of AI, though specifics are unclear. Most of the initiatives revolve around topics of trade, national security, and privacy.
